# Treasurenet

Treasurenet proposes a solution for the critical lack of sustaining and tangible value in the crypto world. Our goal is
the combine real world economic drivers and distributed ledger scalability. As a layer 1 protocol, TN will become a
model for sustaining value in the fiat world and the digital world.

# Treasurenet Javascript Libraries - Proto

<a href="https://github.com/treasurenetprotocol/treasurenet-js-libs/blob/master/LICENSE"><img alt="License: Apache-2.0" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache_2.0-blue"/></a>  <img alt="npm: v9.5.1" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/npm-v9.5.1-yellow" />

Protobuf files used to generate cosmos and Treasurenet transactions.

## Installation

```shell
    npm install @treasurenet/proto
```

## Local generation

Requirements:

- ```brew install protoc```
- ```npm install -g protoc-gen-ts```

To generate the protobuf files on linux instead of OSX, remove the empty string after ```sed -i ''```

```shell
./scripts/get_proto_files.sh
./scripts/create_proto_files.sh
./scripts/remove_grpc.sh
./scripts/remove_unused_dependencies.sh
```

## Note

The lib `@grpc/grpc-js` was not included in the `package.json`, and all the services were manually removed from the autogenerated proto files to avoid having that dependency.
This lib is just a tool to create the transactions, not to interact with a GRPC server, if you need the complete proto file you can locally run `./scripts/get_proto_files.sh` and `./scripts/create_proto_files.sh`
